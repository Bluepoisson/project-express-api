# Express API Project
Using Express server create an API with restful endpoints which return and array of data or a single item.

## The problem
Create several endpoints using params and queries from local Netflix data. 
Limitations: listed query needs to be precisely written (uppercase, spacing etc )and 404 does not behave as expected. If I had more time I would use reg ex for the queries and investigate the faulty 404  return.
